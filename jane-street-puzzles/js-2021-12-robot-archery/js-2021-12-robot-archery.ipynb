    "Consider $n$ players playing $k$ races.\n",

    "Now assume the other $n-1$ players are playing the discrete strategy, then the only chance for you to win is\n",
    "1. You allocate all to one race.\n",
    "    1. More than you allocated to this race, and ties are broken randomly.\n",
    "    2. Only you allocted to this race. You win.\n",
    "2. You allocate to several races.\n",
    "    1. Any race you allocated to that someone else participates in, you lose since you allocate less than 1.0.\n",
    "    2. Only you allocated to this race. You win. \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, 1. is the discrete strategy which has been solved. 2. you only win by being the only player allocating to a race. Hence, you will maximise winning chances by participating with any non-zero value in each race.\n",
